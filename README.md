# Neural-Network-Analysis-of-Heat-pipe-using-Hybrid-Nano-Fluids

## Objective of the project
* The main objective of this project is to analyze the performance of a
heat pipe by __Deep Convolution Neural Network (DCNN)__

* This method reduces the time and cost of analyzing any thermal device
by experimental analysis.

## INTRODUCTION – HEAT PIPE

A heat pipe is an ingeniously designed device engineered to efficiently transfer heat from a heat source to a heat sink. This transfer is achieved through the evaporation and condensation of a working fluid contained within a sealed system.

The structure of a heat pipe is divided into three distinct sections:

* __Evaporator Section__: This is the heating zone of the pipe, where the working fluid absorbs heat from the external source, causing it to evaporate.

* __Adiabatic Section__: Also known as the transport section, this part of the pipe is where the vaporized fluid, now carrying the absorbed heat, travels without significant loss or gain of heat.

* __Condenser Section__: In this cooling zone, the vapor releases its heat to the external sink and condenses back into a liquid form.

At its core, a heat pipe is essentially a sealed container, often tube-shaped, lined with a wicking material along its inner walls. This wicking material plays a crucial role in the effective functioning of the heat pipe by facilitating the return of the condensed fluid back to the evaporator section, thereby maintaining a continuous cycle of heat transfer

## Operating Principles of Heat Pipe:

A heat pipe stands out as a remarkably efficient yet simple mechanism capable of transferring substantial amounts of heat across considerable distances. What distinguishes this device is its ability to maintain a nearly constant temperature throughout the process, and it accomplishes this feat without the need for any external power input.

At the heart of a heat pipe's operation are two critical factors: the choice of fluid and the internal operating pressure. These elements are intricately linked to the heat pipe's operating temperature.

* __Selection of Fluid__: The working fluid inside a heat pipe is chosen based on its ability to undergo phase changes (evaporation and condensation) efficiently at the desired operating temperatures. The fluid must have suitable thermodynamic properties, ensuring it can evaporate when absorbing heat at the source and condense when releasing heat at the sink.

* __Operating Pressure__: The pressure within the heat pipe is precisely controlled and tailored to complement the characteristics of the chosen fluid. This pressure regulation is crucial as it directly influences the boiling and condensation points of the fluid, thereby dictating the efficiency and effectiveness of the heat transfer process.

By balancing these two aspects – the fluid type and the operating pressure – a heat pipe can function optimally within its intended temperature range, making it an invaluable tool in a myriad of thermal management applications.

__Silver Nanoparticles (Ag)__ and its Preperation

Silver nano-particles are nano particles of silver of between __1 nm and 100 nm__ in

__SODIUM CITRATE REDUCTION METHOD HAS BEEN ADOPTED
FOR THE PREPARATION OF SILVER NANOPARTICLE.__

Silver nanofluid solutions were prepared through the reduction of silver nitrate in an aqueous solution using citrate. __10 mg of AgNO₃__ was dissolved in 50 ml of double-distilled water, and this solution was brought to a boil. Subsequently, a 1% solution of sodium citrate was added dropwise over a period of 10 minutes. The solution was maintained at a boil for approximately 1 hour. The final product exhibited a greenish-yellow color and had an absorption maximum at 444 nm.

__Aluminium Oxide (Alumina) Nanoparticles (Al₂O₃) and Its Preperation__

Aqueous solutions of aluminum nitrate and urea were prepared at the desired concentrations. These solutions were then mixed together and heated until the temperature reached 100°C. The reaction produced aluminum hydroxide, a gelatinous precipitate, which was subsequently filtered and heated to temperatures above 250°C.

The final product obtained was alumina nanoparticles in powder form.

The __Alumina__ nanoparticles were then mixed with distilled water and placed in an ultrasonic vibrator to form an alumina nanofluids.
